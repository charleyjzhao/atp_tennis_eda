# ATP World Tour Match Results EDA

For this project, my partner and I conducted exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas on ATP World Tour data spanning 1970-2019. The objective was to answer the following four questions:

1. What is the likelihood of a player winning the match after losing the first set in a best of three sets tennis match? After losing the first two sets in a best of five sets tennis match?
2. Does the number of aces from the winner relative to the number of aces from the loser in a match correlate to a greater likelihood to win the match?
3. How much has mid-match retirement or pre-match withdrawal rate changed?
4. Within a group of players with similar match win/loss ratio, who performs better during the four majors (largest tournaments)? How much do stakes matter?

Our analysis can be found in ATP_Tennis_EDA.ipynb.
